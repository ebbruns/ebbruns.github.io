    <h3>The Story So Far</h3>

    <p>
        I was born in Scotland, grew up in Illinois, and went to Grinnell College in Iowa to study Math
        and Computer Science. After graduating in May 2016, I began looking for a job, but found that the uncertainty 
        surrounding the future of the country with the upcoming election had slowed the job market down. So, while
        continuing my search for a job, I've been taking on a number of side projects to keep myself busy. This site 
        is one of the code-related ones, because although I've worked in web development before, I've never had the luxury
        of working in a system I fully understand, and I think experience on a small scale project like this could 
        improve my understanding of web development at large. The other code project I've been working on is a Java 
        program called GolfScorer Pro. This application was designed for a local women's golf league to simplify the
        task of figuring out who has won the season. Both of these are licensed under GPL 3.0, and the sourcecode is 
        available on my <a href="https://github.com/ebbruns">Github</a>.

        <br /> <br />

        Another interest of mine I'm taking this opportunity to explore is my love of art. I took several art classes at
        Grinnell, and had multiple pieces featured in a pop-up gallery show in downtown Grinnell. My art page features
        some short videos I've created to explore the nature of privacy and art, as well as a selection of my watercolors.
