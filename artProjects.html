        These sculptures were featured in the Pop Up gallery in Grinnell, Iowa in 2016.
        "There's a Body in the Corner" and "Notable Crush (Friday Night)" were destroyed shortly after their period of display,
        in the making of "A Video Thoughtfully Discussing the Nature of Art Itself".
